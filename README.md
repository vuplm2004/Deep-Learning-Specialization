# Deep Learning Specialization

- Build and train deep neural networks, identify key architecture parameters, implement vectorized neural networks and deep learning to applications.
- Build a CNN and apply it to detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply algorithms to image and video data.
- Train test sets, analyze variance for DL applications, use standard techniques and optimization algorithms, and build neural networks in TensorFlow.
- Build and train RNNs, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to perform NER and Question Answering.
